MOVE 37 - Reinforcement Deep Learning 
======================================

A free online [course](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) on Reinforcement Deep Learning by Siraj Rawal. The course famously gets its name 'MOVE 37' from ALPHAGO's game changing 37th move against Lee Sedol during the second game in a series of 5 GO games.
